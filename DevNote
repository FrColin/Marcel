Lua user function
=================

Lua stores its own information in a context which is not thread safe.
I had 2 options :
1/ to create a dedicated context per section (implemented as thread), but in this case, each and every callback lives its own life and can't share code or information with others
2/ to use an unique context and lock it's access.

I choose the 2nd way which is more "natural" for users, but as a consequence, only one callback can run at a time. It means callbacks must be as fast as possible to avoid dead locks.
